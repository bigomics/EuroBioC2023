STANDARD DEPLOYMENT FOR OPG V3 USING DOCKER SWARM + TRAEFIK
===========================================================


HOWTO
=====

1. Edit the file settings.env with the correct names for the server

2. Remember to set CNAME for your domain in the DNS registry to
redirect all subdomain traffic to the primary domain.

3. Comment out the Let's Encrypt staging server in traefik.yml

5. Check and edit the makefile if you want to remove/add extra
services.

4. Run 'make init' to initialize the swarm. If needed you need to set
the correct addvertise-addr for the manager.

5. Run 'make deploy' (or just make) to deploy the stack. 


YAML files
==========

app.yml        	Main OmicsPlayground application
traefik.yml    	Reverse proxy and load balancer


NOTES
======

- When copying the app.yml for additional apps, do not forget to
  renames the app name in the traefik labels. For example this
  <LABEL>:

  	  traefik.http.routers.<LABEL>.entrypoints=http

- Do not forget to change the button links in html/index.html if you
  are serving the www page.
